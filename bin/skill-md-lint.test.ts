/**
 * Structural lint for `skills/pipeline/flow-pipeline/SKILL.md`.
 *
 * The supervisor's "do not end the turn between sub-skills" contract
 * is now enforced by the `flow-stop-guard` Stop hook (see SKILL.md's
 * "Harness-level enforcement (Stop hook)" section). The previous
 * load-bearing layer was a leading "DO NOT END THE TURN" blockquote
 * at every step heading; that text-only defence proved insufficient
 * in the May 2026 chore-intent incident and was removed. The lint now
 * anchors on what the harness mechanism reads (the new pending-end
 * phase strings + a reference to the helper) so a doc rename can't
 * silently drift away from the guard's contract.
 *
 * Also lints two cross-doc invariants for the named Task-tool
 * exemptions: AGENTS.md `## Don'ts` and flow-pipeline/SKILL.md "Hard
 * rules" must list the same set of exemptions, and the JSON schema
 * for the Fix-Applier Subagent's artifact must match between
 * pr-review/SKILL.md and pr-review/references/fix-applier-instructions.md.
